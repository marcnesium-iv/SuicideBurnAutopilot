# SuicideBurnAutopilot

"Suicide Burn Autopilot" is a Python script using the Kerbal Space Program mods KRPC and MechJeb to land a spacecraft by performing a suicide burn maneuver.

## Requirements
- Kerbal Space Program (KSP)
- KSP mods:
  - MechJeb2
  - KRPC
- Python 2.7
- Python packages:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - krpc

Porting the script to Python 3.x should be comparably easy as only `print` and `xrange` have to be replaced. However, I did not test that.
